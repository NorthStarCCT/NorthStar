# NorthStar
NorthStar is a curriculum conversation tool. Its purpose is to support and encourage staff to have meaningful, purposeful conversations around programmes/modules, specifically focusing on how these reflect TU Dublin high strategic elements. Often such high strategic elements (CoCreated Curriculum Shapers, Strategic Pillars, Graduate attributes, 1st Year Experience etc.) are considered at the end of the curriculum design process. This tool encourages a different approach – one where TU Dublin’s High strategic elements inform the whole process of curriculum development so that they are built-in as opposed to built-on.
