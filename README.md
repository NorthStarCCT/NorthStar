# NorthStar
<p>NorthStar is a curriculum conversation tool. Its purpose is to support and encourage staff to have meaningful, purposeful conversations around programmes/modules, specifically focusing on how these reflect TU Dublin high strategic elements. Often such high strategic elements (CoCreated Curriculum Shapers, Strategic Pillars, Graduate attributes, 1st Year Experience etc.) are considered at the end of the curriculum design process. This tool encourages a different approach – one where TU Dublin’s High strategic elements inform the whole process of curriculum development so that they are built-in as opposed to built-on. </p>
<b>NorthStar</b>
<ul>
  <li>encourages programme teams to engage in focused and meaningful conversations around curricula.</li>
  <li>stimulates the conversation by offering a series of questions designed to identify where the high strategic elements already exist.</li>
  <li>encourages deeper reflection (using a series of specific prompts) to consider opportunities to shape the curriculum with those high strategic elements in mind.</li>
  <li>allows programme teams to capture their conversation in the form of an Exemplar.</li>
  <li>Encourages staff to share their exemplars with the wider teaching and learning community, so that we can all learn from each other.</li>
</ul>


<b>Open access resources</b>

NorthStar will be hosted on a GitHub account (https://github.com/NorthStarCCT), all design and development resources will be freely available on completion.

The completed web-based tool will be temporarily hosted on https://NorthStarCCT.ie though the intention is that is will be incorporated into the TU Dublin website
